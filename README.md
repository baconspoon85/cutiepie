A funky little 10.5u with cain-style spacebars. Support for 3u and 4u spacebar bottom row layouts has been added, but there is no support for 2u's. If you want to use split space with this, use 1.75u's!


## Layout options

## Production files
Initial prototypes of this PCB without ISO support and only the 1.75u spacebar layout have been ordered and confirmed to work. This PCB has been updated since then to include ISO support and additional 3u and 4u bottom row layouts, and the current iteration of the PCB has not yet been tested. It should theoretically work, but I am not responsible for your orders with a pcb manu. No support will be provided, order at your own risk.

## Case files
Case files are provided in this repo for 3d printing, but I largely have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to case design, so they may or may not be heavily scuffed. Use at your own risk.

## Special Thanks
- [SST60](https://github.com/dededecline/SST60), this project heavily lifts the rp2040 wiring from it, without it I wouldn't have even known where to start
