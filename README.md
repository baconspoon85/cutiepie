# cutiepie
A funky little 10.5u with dual 1.75u spacebars. Support for 3u and 4u spacebar bottom row layouts has been added, as well as support for 2x2u's using the 4u top. 2u's are forced stabless, otherwise a redesign of the pcb layout would have been necessitated.

## Layout options

An ortho pcb is also now available as well.

The vial firmware has been updated to visually support uniform stagger, regular stagger, and ortho, but your existing firmware will also work since the pinouts have not changed.


## Production files
The current version of this pcb that supports all above layouts has been ordered and confirmed to work, but I am not responsible for your orders with a pcb manu. No support will be provided, order at your own risk.

You will also need a daughterboard for this keyboard. It was designed around the ai03 C3 daughterboard.

## Case files
Case files are provided in this repo for 3d printing.

The case is designed around m2 screws and heatset inserts. The top will need 6 M2x4mm inserts, and M2x5mm screws. The daughterboard mounting in the bottom will need 4 M2x3mm inserts, and M2x4mm screws.

The cutouts for the feet in the bottom of the case are sized for primekb feet.

## Special Thanks
- [SST60](https://github.com/dededecline/SST60), this project heavily lifts the rp2040 wiring from it, without it I wouldn't have even known where to start
- 4u spacebar footprint is by [drhigsby](https://github.com/drhigsby)
- Thick plates were created from plates generated by bears' [Keyboard Case Generator](https://github.com/gleorepo/Keyboard-Case-Generator)
- Symmetric case and plate were modified by Chronomap
