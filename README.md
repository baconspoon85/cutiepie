A funky little 10.5u with dual 1.75u spacebars. Support for 3u and 4u spacebar bottom row layouts has been added, but there is not currently support for 2u's. If you want to use split space with this, use 1.75u's!

## Layout options

## Production files
The current version of this pcb that supports all above layouts has been ordered and confirmed to work, but I am not responsible for your orders with a pcb manu. No support will be provided, order at your own risk.

You will also need a daughterboard for this keyboard. It was designed around the ai03 C3 daughterboard.

## Case files
Case files are provided in this repo for 3d printing.

The case is designed around m2 screws and heatset inserts. The top will need 6 M2x4mm inserts, and M2x5mm screws. The daughterboard mounting in the bottom will need 4 M2x3mm inserts, and M2x4mm screws.

The cutouts for the feet in the bottom of the case are sized for primekb feet.

## Special Thanks
- [SST60](https://github.com/dededecline/SST60), this project heavily lifts the rp2040 wiring from it, without it I wouldn't have even known where to start

- Thick plates were created from plates generated by bears' [Keyboard Case Generator](https://github.com/gleorepo/Keyboard-Case-Generator)
