Included in this directory are several PCB and plate files for Cutiepie by Flamwenco. Pay close attention to compatibility notes. These PCB's and plates are NOT compatible with the original 2x1.75u and 3u case tops, or the original non-symmetrical case bottom. Choose a plate option that will support your desired layout, including stabilizers.
	
-Hotswap, Uniform Stagger
	-Integrated RP2040
	-No ISO Enter support
	-Uses uniform 0.25u stagger, as with the original cutiepie
	-Support for both 2u x 2 and 4u stabilizers.
	-Requires the symmetrical uniform or dual stagger plate for 2u stabilizer support.
	-Requires the symmetrical top and bottom cases with only 2x2u or 4u spacebar support.
	-Compatible with original "cutiepie2040" PCB firmware due to 1-for-1 pinout match.

-Hotswap, Standard Stagger
	-Integrated RP2040
	-No ISO Enter support
	-Option for uniform 0.25u stagger, or traditional 0.5u stagger between the "A" and "Z" row.
	-Support for both 2u x 2 and 4u stabilizers.
	-Requires the symmetrical standard or dual stagger plate for 2u stabilizer support.
	-Requires the symmetrical top and bottom cases with only 2x2u or 4u spacebar support.
	-Compatible with original "cutiepie2040" PCB firmware due to 1-for-1 pinout match.

-Solder Only, Dual Stagger (Uniform and Standard) BLE
	-Integrated nRF52840 via Holyiot-18010-nRF52840 module
	-No ISO Enter support
	-Option for traditional 0.5u stagger between the "A" and "Z" row.
	-Support for both 2u x 2 and 4u stabilizers.
	-Requires the symmetrical standard or dual stagger plate for 2u stabilizer support.
	-Requires the symmetrical top and bottom cases with only 2x2u or 4u spacebar support.
	-Custom ZMK firmware

-Dual Stagger Plate
	-Maintains ISO switch and stabilizers support for future compatibility with symmetrical case PCBs supporting ISO Enter.
	-"Z" row switch cutouts support both standard and uniform stagger.
	-May be difficult to achieve perfect left-to-right alignment with 3-pin switches.
	-Gerbers for FR4 plates included with KiCad project files.

-Standard Stagger and Uniform Stagger Plates
	-Maintains ISO switch and stabilizers support for future compatibility with symmetrical case PCBs supporting ISO Enter.
	-Separate plates for each stagger option for better alignment with 3-pin switches.
	-Gerbers for FR4 plates included with KiCad project files.
